# Code Challenge 1-3 Battle Game

My intention building this project was to learn to handle data and save it in Java as well as learning about code reusability. 

# About the game
A simple battle-game in which you play the game in the console. 
The program generates automatically an NPC character which the player fights against. After every battle round, depending on if the player wins or loses the HP will be restored to a random amount. If the player wins they can add the weapon of their attacker to their inventory.
When the game is quit, the player has the chance to save all progress and continue later from a save file.
